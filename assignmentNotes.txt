-Here we go I actually made a text file instead of a directory this time. I accidentally did mkdir instead of touch last time. Time to rewrite the notes I took!


-Open the assignment folder in vscode
-Shouldn't move any files or edit any outside of the assignment folder.
-Commented instructions should be inside of the folders I need to edit. I can do as much as I want in the files, but the commented instructions are necessary.

-Make sure to constantly check and test work
-When ready to save, go back to terminal and in the assignment folder type:
git add .
git commit -m "[insert commit message here]"

-For the 'helloWorld.js' file, I will need to source it into my 'index.html' file.

-Use git to upload the work to github
-Submit a link to my assigment repository through the student portal

-Don't forget to submit this weeek's discussion answer!!! I know you have good things to say you just need to finish writing them all out because there's a lot.
